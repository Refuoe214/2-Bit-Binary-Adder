# 2-Bit-Binary-Adder

## Overview 

A 2-bit binary adder is a digital circuit used to perform the addition of two 2-bit binary numbers. 

### Aim

The main purpose of a 2-bit binary adder is to compute the sum of two 2-bit binary numbers. This is important in various applications, including digital calculators.

### How it works

A 2-bit binary adder operates by taking two 2-bit binary inputs and producing a 2-bit binary sum and a carry-out. The operation is as follows:

1. The two numbers to be added are represented using 2 bits: the first number A=A1A0 and the second number B=B1B0.

2. The adder consists of two half adders: one processes the least significant bits(LSBs) while the other, the most significant bits(MSBs) using OR, AND, and XOR gates.

3. The last bit of the output, being the second bit of the sum is generated as the sum of the LSB half adder, while the first bit of the sum, being the middle bit of the output is generated by combining the carry out of the LSB half adder with the sum of the MSB half adder and the carry out of the output, being the first bit of the output is generated by passing the carry outs of the two half adders into an OR operation.

### Applications

2-bit binary adders are basis of larger arithmetic circuits, such as 4-bit, and in building complex systems like CPUs.
